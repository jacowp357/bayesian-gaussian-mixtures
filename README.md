# bayesian-gaussian-mixtures
Simple example of uni-variate GMM using Infer.NET 

The notebook can be used to generate mixtures of uni-variate Gaussian distributed data in Python, which is exported as a csv file. The c# code reads the csv file data and learns the parameters associated with a Gaussian distribution to describe the data.
